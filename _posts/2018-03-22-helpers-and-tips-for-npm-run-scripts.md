Iâ€™d like to point to [Why npm Scripts?](https://css-tricks.com/why-npm-scripts/) if you want to read an introduction to the benefits of using CLI tools via npm scripts in favor of a task runner like Gulp and their plugin eco system.

## Introduction

You can easily [run scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) using npm by adding them to the `"scripts"` field in package.json and run them with `npm run <script-name>`. Run `npm run` to see available scripts. Binaries of locally install packages are made available in the `PATH`, so you can run them by name instead of pointing to `node_modules/.bin/name`.

```json
{
	"name": "my-package",
	"scripts": {
		"lint": "eslint ."
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"eslint": "^4.19.0"
	}
}
```

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

----

## Lifecycle scripts

npm comes with predefined [lifecyle scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) which are excuted under specific conditions when they are defined in your package.json.

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "scripts": {
    "prepublishOnly": "nsp check"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nsp": "^3.2.1"
  }
}
```

This will be executed automatically before your npm package is published to the registry via `npm publish` to check for known vulnerabilties in your dependencies.

__Note: *prepublishOnly* is available since npm v4.0.0. See [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#deprecation-note).__

### Â»npm startÂ« and Â»npm testÂ«

These are also lifecycle scripts (but arenâ€™t executed automatically). 

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest-cli": "^22.4.2"
  }
}
```

Therefore they can be executed simply with:

```bash
$ npm test
$ npm start
```

### Â»preÂ« and Â»postÂ« scripts

Â»preÂ« and Â»postÂ« scripts are special lifecycle scripts which can be used to run scripts automatically in sequence.

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "scripts": {
    "pretest": "eslint .",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^4.19.0",
    "jest-cli": "^22.4.2"
  }
}
```

```bash
$ npm test
```

This will lint your files before running your tests. The tests will not run if linting fails, or more generally: the following script wonâ€™t be executed if one of the scripts running in sequence exits with an exit code other than 0.

__Note: Â»preÂ« and Â»postÂ« scripts can also be used for your custom npm scripts. So `npm run foo` will also run `prefoo` and `postfoo` if defined.__

## Options for npm scripts

#### Passing options to used commands
 
You can pass options to the command you are using in your npm script by adding `-- --flag` like in the example below.
 
```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "xo",
    "lint:fix": "npm run lint -- --fix",
  }
}
```
 
Adding the `-- --fix ` option is like executing `xo --fix`.

### Silent option
 
`npm run` has a `--silent` option which is especially useful when combining npm scripts in npm scripts.
 
Imagine you have a setup for linting your JavaScript files like the following:
 
```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "xo",
    "lint:fix": "npm run lint --silent -- --fix",
  }
}
```
 
Using the --silent option reduces the output in the Terminal. See this [comparison](https://twitter.com/mkuehnel/status/957965749473210369).

## Helper packages

### Watch tasks 

There are several packages which enable running scripts when files changed. Personally, [onchange](https://github.com/Qard/onchange) offers the best combination of ease of use and flexibility. 

```json
{
	"name": "my-package",
	"scripts": {
		"lint": "eslint src",
    "lint:watch": "onchange \"src/**/*.js\" -- npm run lint --silent"
	}
}
```

So `npm run lint:watch` will watch for changes in the file system and will automatically run eslint when a file changes.

### Get notified in error cases

[cli-error-notifier](https://github.com/micromata/cli-error-notifier) sends native desktop notifications when npm scripts fail.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "onerror \"eslint src\"",
  }
}
```

This is especially useful for watching files while developing in conjunction with `onchange`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src",
    "lint:fix": "npm run lint --silent -- --fix",
    "lint:watch": "onchange \"src/**/*.js\" -- onerror \"npm run lint --silent\""
  }
}
```

### Run multiple scripts in parallel or serial

Using [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all) offers the following advantages:

- can increase readability of the scripts section in your package.json via glob-like patterns  
  Before:

  ```json
  npm run clean && npm run build:css && npm run build:js && npm run build:html
  ```

  After:
  
  ```json
  npm-run-all clean build:*
  ```
- compared to using `npm run foo & npm run bar` 
  - running scripts in parallel works on Windows
  - multiple scripts which are listening to file changes can run parallel 

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npm-run-all clean --parallel webpack:server lint:watch",
    "build": "npm-run-all security test clean webpack",
  }
}
```

### Remembering npm run scripts

Depending on the amount of tasks it might be hard to remember each and every task name. A faster alternative to use `npm run` to list all available tasks is to use an awesome little helper tool called [ntl](https://github.com/ruyadorno/ntl) to show an interactive list of task to choose from ðŸ’¥

## Beyond npm scripts

### Wrap your npm scripts setup to improve maintainibility and user experience

There are two things which might have a downside when your setup becomes more and more complex:

- Not being able to describe your tasks to your users.
  - You might want to upvote [this issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/18515) on the npm issues tracker to fix this.
- The lack of using comments in package.json.

As workaround for both you can use a tool like [nps](https://github.com/kentcdodds/nps) which claims to have Â»all the benefits of npm scripts without the cost of a bloated package.json and limits of jsonÂ«.

#### The solution of nps

It allows you to move your scripts to a `package-scripts.js` file. Because this file is a JavaScript file, you can do a lot more with your project scripts.

```javascript
const npsUtils = require('nps-utils') // not required, but handy!

module.exports = {
  scripts: {
    default: 'node index.js',
    lint: 'eslint .',
    test: {
      default: 'jest',
      watch: {
        script: 'jest --watch',
        description: 'run in the amazingly intelligent Jest watch mode'
      }
    },
    build: {
      default: 'webpack',
      prod: 'webpack -p',
    },
    // learn more about npsUtils here: https://npm.im/nps-utils
    validate: npsUtils.concurrent.nps('lint', 'test', 'build'),
  },
}
```

### Using npx with locally installed dependencies instead of npm run scripts

npm [comes bundled](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) with `npx` (since v5.2.0) â€” a tool to execute package binaries which is great to use packages globally without the need to install them globally.

But itâ€™s also pretty useful for locally installed dependencies in your project.

*Each command called with `npx` is executed either from the local `node_modules/.bin` directory, or from a central cache, installing any packages needed in order to run a command.*
 
```json
{
	"name": "my-package",
	"scripts": {
		"lint": "xo"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"xo": "^0.20.0"
	}
}
```

```bash
npx xo --fix
```

This executes the locally installed version of XO from `node_modules/.bin`.
