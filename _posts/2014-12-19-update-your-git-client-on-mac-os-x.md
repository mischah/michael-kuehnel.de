          I like to assist you just in case you wonder how to react on yesterdays announcement of that critical Git security vulnerability. As said within this <a href="https://github.com/blog/1938-vulnerability-announced-update-your-git-clients">post</a> on Githubs Blog it’s strongly recommended to update your Git clients as soon as possible. Here we go with a short instruction how to update in case you are using OS X.

## 1. If you’re already using Homebrew

```bash
`brew update && brew upgrade git` or `brew update && brew install git`
```

Entering `git --version` should echo → `git version 2.14.1` afterwards.

In case it’s saying something like `Git 1.9.x (Apple)` instead you have to add `export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH` to your environment variables via `.bashrc` or however you handle that. See [my dotfiles](https://github.com/mischah/dotfiles/commit/44fae96e96b5721c0e349fafdc1172e78278979c).

After restarting your terminal  `git --version` should print → `git version 2.14.1`.

And you’re safe using Git via the command line.

## 2. If you don’t use Homebrew

Get [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and start reading at »[1. If your already using Homebrew](#if-youre-already-using-homebrew)«.

## Update your Git Gui

In case you’re a using a Git client like Tower oder SourceTree you have to tell those apps which Git version they should use. You can set this via the Applications Preferences hitting `⌘ + ,` on your Keyboard.
