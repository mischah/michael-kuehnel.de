excerpt: "Just in case you’re working with Sass as CSS preprocessor and are forced to use Eclipse for a certain project (huhu, Liferay theming). In this case you might wonder why the hell there is no Sass editor plugin within the marketplace to enable at least syntax highlighting for *.scss files. I guess you would be like »Whatever, just hit google (or DuckDuckGo) and find something suitable in a matter of seconds.«"

Just in case you’re working with Sass as CSS preprocessor and are forced to use Eclipse for a certain project (huhu, Liferay theming :grin:). In this case you might wonder why the hell there is no Sass editor plugin within the marketplace to enable at least syntax highlighting for `*.scss` files. I guess you would be like »Whatever, just hit google (DuckDuckGo) and find something suitable in a matter of seconds.«

Let me tell you that it is »pretty hard« to »impossible« to find a solution online. But then a workmate pointed out that it is possible to install the eclipse based and frontend focused web development IDE [Aptana Studio](http://aptana.com/) as plugin into eclipse. :flushed:

Read the following quote from the [download page](http://aptana.com/downloads/start):

1. From the Help menu, select »Install New Software …« to open the Install New Software dialog.  
2. Paste the URL for the update site into the Work With text box, and hit the Enter (or Return) key.  
3. In the populated table below, check the box next to the name of the plug-in, and then click the Next button.  
4. Click the Next button to go to the license page.
5. Choose the option to accept the terms of the license agreement, and click the Finish button.
6. You may need to restart Eclipse to continue.

Bamn! :boom: … You now have .scss support baked in Eclipse.
